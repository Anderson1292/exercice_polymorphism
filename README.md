# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a feature that allows the programmer to use the same name for methods.

However, the programmer needs to follow some essential rules for the polymorphism to happen without it getting lost in the data stream. In literature we find that polymorphism is the principle by which two or more classes derived from the same superclass can invoke methods that have the same identification, signature, but different behaviors, specialized for each derived class, using for that purpose a reference to an object of the superclass type.
